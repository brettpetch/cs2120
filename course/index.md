Welcome to COMPSCI 2120/COMPSCI 9642/DIGIHUM 2220!
===================================================

This is the primary website for Computer Science 2120/9642 and Digital Humanities 2220, at Western University.

This is very much a social and *interactive* course, so a lot of the course interaction will be taking place on OWL.

If you're stuck on something, or have a question, post on the OWL forums for the class. I really suggest using the forums, they will be invaluable. The TAs and I will check regularly but, in past experience, most people get quick answers from peers in the class. If you answer enough peer questions, I'll give you some mark consideration. For real!
